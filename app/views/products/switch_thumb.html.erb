            Manufacturing, process automation, and measurement systems often require the input of data (number or code) by an operator. Front panel mounted<strong> Interswitch</strong> thumbwheel switches are generally ideal for these types of applications. We offer 15 distinct types of thumbwheel switches to choose from, starting with type N, the smallest, and ending with type G, the largest. These switches are available in 21 standard codes and can be ganged from one up to 25 characters (side-by-side) and configured with alphabetic or numeric characters embossed in each wheel position (1 to 7 position versions are available). Customers chose solder types and PCB pins or connector terminations; all connectors are gold plated to insure you get years of trouble-free service. Working voltage ranges up to 50 volts DC. 
              All (AND Displays, Interfan, AND Optoelectronics, Interswitch, or Interoptics) products are covered by a one-year  <a href="/warranty">warranty</a> against defects in materials or workmanship.
