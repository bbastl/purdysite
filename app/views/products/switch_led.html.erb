Manufacturing, process automation, and measurement systems often require the input of data (number or code) by an operator. Front panel mounted<strong> Interswitch</strong> 7-segment LED display switches are generally ideal for these types of applications. The 7-segment LED displays feature parallax-free reading and have character heights of 9, 10, 16, 25, 35, and 45mm. The individual modules (characters) are 20 to 40mm wide, can be assembled (ganged) to form blocks of any size, and come in black or gray.
All (AND Displays, Interfan, AND Optoelectronics, Interswitch, or Interoptics) products are covered by a one-year  <a href="/warranty">warranty</a> against defects in materials or workmanship. 
          <p> They are particularly suitable for combination assemblies with the Interswitch thumbwheel switches. Depending on the application, the modules are available with TTL and C-MOS logic. The program also includes modules with matching elements for expanded supply voltage ranges ranging from 5 to 24VDC.</p>
